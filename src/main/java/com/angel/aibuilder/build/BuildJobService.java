                            - Place a deliberate foundation/ground plane, main floors, support posts/columns, room boundaries, tower level markers, and any basement/raised platform structure.
                            - Reserve comfortable interior volumes now: normal rooms and halls need at least 3 clear air blocks above the walkable floor. If a floor is y=F, reserve y=F+1..F+3 as empty headroom and put ceilings/beams/upper floors at y=F+4 or higher.
                            - Do not subdivide the footprint into tiny furnished rooms. Normal rooms should have at least a 4x4 clear interior area after walls, with 5x5 or larger preferred. Use fewer/larger rooms, open plans, alcoves, or lofts instead of unusable closets.
                            - Reserve clear entrance positions, stairwell shafts, atriums, courtyards, or central paths with air where later stages will add doors and stairs.
                            - If the build has multiple floors, reserve a real vertical route now: stairs need enough horizontal run plus bottom/top landing space, while ladders need a clear shaft and standing cells at both ends. If the footprint is tight, plan ladders or exterior stair towers instead of oversized stairs. Use spiral stairs only when you can reserve a true 3x3+ shaft with player headroom and landings.
                            - Do not add furniture, decorations, random plants, or final roof detail in this stage.

                            - Add walls with depth: pillars, trim, material variation, buttresses, frames, or recesses where appropriate.
                            - Keep the reserved 3-block interior headroom clear. Wall trim, crossbeams, and logs may frame room edges, but should not run through room centers, main paths, doorways, or stair approaches at head height.
                            - Pillars/posts should reach from the floor/foundation to the ceiling beam, upper floor, balcony, porch roof, or roof they support. Do not make supports that stop one or two blocks too low.
                            - Add doors/gates and window glass/panes with correct orientation and clear air around them.
                            - Cap every real door opening with an intentional lintel, arch, beam, full-width transom, awning, or matching wall/trim. A door uses y=D and y=D+1; the header row at y=D+2 must be filled across the full door width. Do not clear y=D+2 for a doorway unless you immediately refill it with header/transom blocks.
                            - Glass panes, iron bars, fences, walls, and chains are valid, but they must connect correctly. Give them same-level neighboring connector blocks or solid frame blocks, or set explicit connection states so they visually attach instead of rendering as tiny isolated slivers.
                            - For panes, use helper functions and explicit connection states when useful. In an opening on a fixed-z wall, panes usually need east/west connections like {east: "true", west: "true"}; in an opening on a fixed-x wall, panes usually need north/south connections like {north: "true", south: "true"}. A one-block-wide transom can use a pane if it connects to side frames at the same y; otherwise use full glass/stained_glass or solid trim.
                            - Leave a clear sightline through every window. Do not place solid trim, posts, shelves, furniture, or decor directly in front of panes/glass; place sills and flower boxes below the glass instead.
                            - Keep entrances reachable and unblocked on both sides. Door controls, if any, should work from inside and outside.
                            - Leave stair/ladders/corridors open for the next vertical-access stage.
                            - For non-enterable builds, use this stage for surface depth, silhouette, relief, openings that fit the object, material contrast, and structural detail instead of fake house doors/windows.

                            - For stair roofs, face each stair row toward the roof ridge/center; do not face roof stairs toward the outside edge unless that is intentionally decorative.
                            - For entrance/porch steps and awnings, face stairs back toward the building/door so the low lip points outward.
                            - Add ceilings or upper floor slabs where rooms need separation, without making interiors too low or dark. If the walkable floor is y=F, ceilings, heavy beams, and upper floor blocks belong at y=F+4 or higher over normal rooms.
                            - Add staircases, ladders, landings, railings, trapdoors, or validated 3x3+ spiral access so floors and towers are reachable.
                            - Before placing stairs, check that the route has enough run, a reachable bottom approach, a reachable top landing, and 3 clear air blocks of headroom along the usable path. If that does not fit, use a ladder shaft, exterior stair tower, or fewer floors instead.
                            - Spiral stairs are only acceptable when every step has reachable approach space, 3 clear air blocks above the step, a clear turn/center area, and landings at both ends. If the shaft is smaller than 3x3 or headroom is uncertain, use a ladder instead.
                            - Do not leave stairs behind fences, furniture, windows, posts, walls, or voids where the player cannot enter the first step or exit the last step.

                            - Towers must receive floors/landings and access, not remain hollow tubes.
                            - For non-enterable builds, use this stage for top caps, overhangs, supports, crowns, mechanical parts, silhouette refinement, and safe contained fluids instead of irrelevant ceilings or stair access.

                            - Every enclosed room, tower level, corridor, basement, attic, and dark corner needs appropriate lighting.
                            - Prefer ceiling chains with lanterns, wall torches, chandeliers, hidden sea lantern/glowstone, or style-matching lamps over random floor lights.
                            - Add functional furniture and room purposes: tables, chairs, beds, counters, shelves, storage, workstations, rugs, railings, partitions, or themed props.
                            - Do not spend all detail on the lower floor. Upper floors, lofts, attics, balconies, and tower rooms need their own lights plus several fitting details such as beds, desks, shelves, storage, seating, rugs, lamps, banners, signs, plants, or workstations.
                            - Every normal room or floor zone should include lighting plus several different detail categories: furniture/use, storage/shelves, wall trim/decor, floor detail/rugs, ceiling detail/beams/lights, and small props. Avoid rooms that are just one bed, one chest, or a single bookshelf against blank walls.
                            - Break up large blank walls and floors with beams, trim, shelves, counters, lamps, signs, banners, plants, rugs, mixed floor patterns, alcoves, or material variation while keeping paths usable.
                            - Match furniture to room size. If a room is smaller than a comfortable 4x4 clear interior, treat it as storage, a closet, or an alcove with wall-mounted/simple details; do not force a table, bed, or chairs into it.
                            - Keep at least one usable path and several standing spaces in every furnished room. Furniture must not consume the whole room or block doorways, stairs, ladders, landings, or windows.
                            - Do not place shelves, barrels, bookshelves, tables, potted plants, or lamps directly in front of windows unless they sit below the glass and do not block the view.
                            - Keep main paths, stairs, ladders, landings, and doors usable. Do not block door swings, stair approaches, ladder exits, or landings with furniture.
