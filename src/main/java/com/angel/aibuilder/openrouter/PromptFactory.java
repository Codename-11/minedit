                Minecraft placement quality:
                - For roofs, stairs, slabs, trapdoors, doors, logs, panes, fences, and directional blocks, set explicit block states when orientation matters.
                - Doors and gates need deliberate facing, hinge, open, and powered states. Face them into the doorway correctly, put the hinge on the sensible wall side, and avoid doors that open into walls, furniture, stairs, or exterior trim.
                - Door openings should read from both outside and inside. If a door looks inverted from the approach side, flip facing or hinge rather than leaving it backwards.
                - Doorways, gates, arches, ladders, stairwells, and corridors need clear air space. Do not put roofs, slabs, carpets, lights, walls, furniture, fences, or decorations in the player's path through them.
                - Be careful with roof direction: use stair facing/half/shape consistently so roofs slope outward, corners meet, and stairs are not inverted unless intentionally decorative.
                - Stair facing rule: for Minecraft stairs, facing is the direction of the stair's high/full/back side; the low/open step is on the opposite side. Do not blindly use the outside direction.
                - Trapdoors need deliberate facing, half, and open states. Closed shutters, hatches, counters, and floor covers should close in the intended direction and not block entrances or paths by accident.
                - Slabs are visually half-height but still occupy a block cell. Use type/top/bottom/double intentionally; use double slabs or full blocks for solid-looking floors, walls, caps, and roof seams when half-slabs would leave visible air gaps.
                - Do not stack or mix slabs in ways that create accidental holes under walls, above ceilings, at roof edges, beside stairs, or around doorways.
                - Fences, walls, panes, and gates should connect logically. Use posts/corners/gates/adjacent blocks so railings and enclosures read as continuous, not as random isolated pieces.
                - Avoid roof air gaps. Overlap or cap ridges/corners with slabs, stairs, logs, full blocks, or matching trim.
                - Do not leave accidental empty holes in walls, floors, corners, or roof seams.
                - Place support blocks before dependent blocks.
                - Plants, flowers, saplings, crops, carpets, rails, ladders, torches, lanterns, buttons, pressure plates, vines, and similar fragile blocks need valid support. Put them on/against blocks that can hold them.
                - Do not place plants or flowers on stone, wood, glass, slabs, stairs, or air. Use grass_block, dirt, coarse_dirt, podzol, rooted_dirt, moss_block, farmland, sand, or other valid support as appropriate.
                - Hanging blocks like lanterns/chains should have a solid block, chain, or suitable support above when hanging=true; standing variants need support below.
                - If uncertain about a fragile decorative block's support rules, use a safer full-block decoration instead.
                - Fluid safety: if using water or lava, build a closed basin, channel, pipe, or retaining rim before placing fluid blocks.
                - Do not place water or lava source blocks at the selected footprint edge unless the user explicitly asks for a spill leaving the area.
                - For fountains, put a solid basin floor under the water and a rim high enough to keep water inside the selected footprint.
                - For falling water, include a catch basin below and close side gaps so the fluid cannot escape outside the build area.

    private static final String DETAILED_BUILD_RULES = """
                Default build quality:
                - Unless the user asks for something simple, minimalist, empty, abandoned, or rough, make the build rich and finished. "Compact code" means procedural helper functions and loops, not sparse geometry.
                - Use repeated helper functions to add many details efficiently: pillars, wall trim, beams, window frames, shelves, tables, chairs, beds, counters, rugs, lamps, railings, stair details, plants, banners, supports, and exterior landscaping.
                - Do not produce empty shells, empty towers, empty corridors, or plain unfurnished rooms. Every enclosed room or tower floor must have a visible purpose and at least a few appropriate details.
                - Give interiors real structure: floors, ceilings, partitions, stair/ladders, landings, room transitions, support columns, wall trim, windows, and reachable walkways.
                - Every room, hallway, basement, attic, tower level, and enclosed corner needs lighting. Prefer ceiling chains with lanterns, wall torches, chandeliers, lamps on supports, or hidden glowstone/sea_lantern fixtures that fit the style.
                - Large builds need multiple functional zones. Add bedrooms, storage, workshop, kitchen, throne room, library, guard room, balconies, tower rooms, or utility spaces as appropriate to the prompt.
                - Towers must not be hollow tubes. Add internal floors every 4-6 blocks, ladders/stairs or spiral access, slit windows, lights, railings, and small furniture/decor on each level.
                - Avoid lazy flat boxes. Walls should have depth, columns, buttresses, beams, windows, alcoves, material variation, trim, or relief that matches the style.
                - Keep pathways usable. Main routes should be at least 2 blocks tall and usually 2 blocks wide. Do not let fountains, walls, counters, furniture, plants, roofs, carpets, gates, or decorations block walking routes.
                - Doors, gates, arches, and entrances must be reachable, correctly oriented, visually aligned with the wall, and unblocked on both sides. If you place controls, put usable controls for both entry and exit.
                - Place furniture along walls or in clear zones. Leave central aisles and door swings clear, especially in small rooms and tower landings.
                - Set intentional states for stateful blocks: doors/gates/trapdoors should be open or closed deliberately; levers should be powered or unpowered deliberately; stairs/slabs/lanterns should have correct orientation/half/hanging states.
                - Prefer ceiling chains, hanging lanterns, wall torches, chandeliers, or integrated fixtures over random floor lighting unless floor lights are intentional and visually supported.
                - Keep the style consistent. Materials, roof shape, decorations, landscaping, and interior choices should look like one coherent build, not unrelated chunks.
                - Make shapes readable. Avoid confusing silhouettes, random blobs, unexplained protrusions, and decorative noise that makes the build hard to understand.
                - Before final code, mentally walk through the build from outside to inside and up every tower: doors work, rooms are lit, paths are clear, interiors are furnished, towers have floors/access, fluids are contained, roofs have no gaps, and the style is coherent.
